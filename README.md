# Split-Landing-Page
A mobile friendly split landing page

ORIGIN:
This is a variation of Brad Traversy's "Split Landing Page" Youtube tutorial, which can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRmQN244Ir0&t=28s. Brad has authorized fellow developers to use this project as a personal site, and he has also said it is OK for us to tweak it.

DIFFERENCES:
As I've always been a fan of this design, I've modified Brad's code to suit my needs. Here are the changes I've made:
1) The page will be horizontally split on mobile devices. This is true as long as max-width < 600px.
2) When vertically split, the transition effects also apply to the z-index of the pseudo elements. This means that the text will gradually become opaque 'onmouseleave'.
